            I'm a Devops/Problem  based in Calironia. I went to CalPoly University, but most of what I learned came from personal and entrepreneurial projects. I enjoy building apps, platforms, APIs and everything in between. I'm driven by a strong entrepreneurial spirit, making me always want to build new things and see them grow. When confronted with a challenge, may it be technical or not, I never give up until I found the solution. This might be what describes me best in my daily work
